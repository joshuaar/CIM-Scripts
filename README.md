A series of programs (mostly with command line interfaces) written in various languages.

Each of these solves a specific analysis problem related to peptide microarrays as studied by the [Center for Innovations in Medicine](http://www.biodesign.asu.edu/research/research-centers/innovations-in-medicine)

I wrote these during graduate study.

##Programs with CLI's

Some of these have CLI's associated with them. These are:
fasta2list.py
pepKineticModel.py
seqEntropy.py
seqSummary.py
CalcEnrichments.py
classif3.py
gpr2row.py
list2fasta.py
seqGetTop.py
seqTTest.py
classif2.py
gprConvert2.py
pca.py
seqLinReg.py

Some of these are self explanitory, most are not. Documentation may come soon.
